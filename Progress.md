ðŸ“… **Day 01:** July 20, 2022

**Today's topic**: Google Data Analytics - Visualization

**Todayâ€™s progress:** I made notes for Course number 6, [Share data through the art of visualization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/visualize-data)

**Thoughts:** I remind myself of some of the techniques of effective learning because course material is starting to accumulate. Since I have to make progress and remember everything I've learned so far, I recalled that some of the effective learning techniques had helped me in the past.

**Link to work:** [Calculator App](http://www.example.com/)

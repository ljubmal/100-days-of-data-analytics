**Today's Progress**: I made notes for Course number 6, [Share data through the art of visualization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/visualize-data)

**Thoughts:** I remind myself of some of the techniques of effective learning, because course material is starting to accumulate. Since I have to make progress and remember everything I've learned so far, I recalled that some of the effective learning techniques had helped me in the past.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
